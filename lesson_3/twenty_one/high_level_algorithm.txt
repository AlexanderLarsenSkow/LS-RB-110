Initialize a deck
	- Here, you create a deck of card values first, then take the keys of that and put it in an array. This is the initialized deck
		you use every round. 

Deal two cards to the player 
	- Two cards should be dealt to the player from the deck at random.
	- When the player is dealt two cards, those cards should be deleted from the deck.
	
Display the cards to the user. 
	- Show the cards themselves 
	- Maybe show the card_values as well? I'll decide that one. 
	
Deal two cards to the Computer 
- Add the card_values. 

Ask the user if they want to hit or stay.
	- Display the computer cards to the player
	- If they want to hit, they will be dealt another card.
		#	Display this card to the user.
		# Ask again if they want to hit or stay. Repeat until the user says stay.
		# Prompt error if they don't select hit or stay.
	- If they want to stay, end the player's turn.
		# End the loop basically

Computer Turn: Hit or Stay?
	- The computer should always hit if their card_values are 16 or less.
	- If the computer has 17 or greater, they will stay.
	- If the computer hits higher than 21, they will bust out. 
	
Win Conditions:
	- If someone hits 21 immediately, they win that round immediately and it's a new round.
	- If someone breaks over 21, they lose and the other player wins.
	- Whoever is 21 or under will win OR whoever is closer to 21.

Display Winner and Score: 
	- This can be done later.
